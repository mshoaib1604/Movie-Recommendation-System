**## Movie Recommendation System

A simple and effective Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Pandas, and machine learning techniques such as user–item correlation.
The project recommends movies to users based on similarity of user ratings.

** ##Overview

This project reads movie rating data from a dataset, processes user–movie interactions, and builds a model that recommends similar movies.
It uses:

Pandas for data wrangling

NumPy for computation

Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization

Correlation-based filtering to generate recommendations

This notebook demonstrates how to merge movie metadata and rating data, compute similarity scores, and generate movie recommendations.
